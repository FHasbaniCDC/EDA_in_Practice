## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter can be added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r library}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)
```

What are five basic functions to begin exploring the data object?
```{r 5 func}

```

Create a function to convert cty and hwy to EUR standard 
```{r convert}
mpgTo100km <- function(milespergallon){
  gallonsliter <- 3.78541178
  MileKIlometer <- 1.609344
  
  l100km <- (100*gallonsliter)/(milespergallon*MileKIlometer)
  l100km
}
```

Which manufacturers have the most model car count in the dataset?
Count the manufacturers
```{r count}
# shortcut - pipe operator %>% Crtl-shift-M

```

Find the unique models in the dataset. Use the $ syntax.
```{r unique}

```

How would you describe the relationship between cty and hwy? (relationship of 2 numeric variables)
```{r scatter}

```

Find the total number of observations for a manufacturer-model combination using geom_bar().

```{r combo bar}


```

# Experiment with color, shape and size aesthetic.

# Map color to a continuous value. 
Create a scatterplot of cty and hwy mapping color to displ

```{r}


```

# Map color to categorical value.
Create a scatterplot of cty and hwy mapping color to trans
```{r}

```

# Map more than one aesthetic in a plot. 
Create a scatterplot of cty and hwy mapping color to displ. Use the variable trans to color and size.
```{r}

```

# Map more than one aesthetic in a plot. 
Create a scatterplot of cty and hwy mapping color to displ. Use the variable trans to color and shape.
```{r}

```

# How is drive train related to fuel economy?
# How is drive train related to engine size and class?

Using mpg, group by drive train, drv. Find the mean value of cty then create a bar graph of average value of cty.

What are values of drive train?
```{r}

```

How many, on average, cty miles can I drive if I had a f? 4? or r? drive train, drv?
```{r}

```

How many, on average, hwy miles can I drive if I had a f? 4? or r? drive train, drv?
```{r}

```

How is drive train, drv, (char) related to engine size, displ (cont) and class (char)?
Use the option position= "dodge" in the geometry.
```{r}

```

What happens if you try to facet a continuous variable hwy? or cty?
Use the option position= "dodge" in the geometry.
```{r}

```

Facet a categorical variable, cyl, instead.
Use the option position= "dodge" in the geometry.
```{r}

```

# when we facet a continuous variable it is a little harder to read

Create a scatterplot of displ and cty
```{r}

```

# Use faceting to explore a 3-way relationship betweem fuel economy,cty,  engine size, displ and number of cylinders.

Using a scatterplot, evaluate the relationship using a 3 variables. 
```{r}

```

Evaluate the relationship between cty and hwy miles.
```{r}

```

What is the dimension of the dataframe, mpg? Do we see all points?
Create a jitter plot instead.
```{r}


```

Convert the variable class into a factor
Create boxplots by class indicating hwy miles
```{r}
library(forcats)

```
